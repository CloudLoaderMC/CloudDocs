# Compatibility

**Cloud aims to support the following loaders' mods:**

* [X] Forge
* [X] Fabric
* [ ] Quilt
* [ ] Rift
* [ ] Liteloader
* [ ] Sponge
* [ ] Bukkit & derivatives

In the future, Fabric will be replaced by Quilt (Quilt supports Fabric mods as well) inside of Cloud, and a decision will be made on NeoForged once there is more information on it.
