# FAQ

### What is Cloud?
Cloud is a new Minecraft mod loader built for inter-loader compatibility and the end-user experience. It aims to actively support as many different loaders' mods as possible and to provide a nice, clean environment to manage everything mod-related in-game, all while keeping almost everything configurable.

### What does Cloud currently support?
Cloud currently only supports Forge mods, but Fabric support is nearly ready.

### What loader is Cloud based on?
Cloud was originally forked from Forge instead of another loader like Fabric or Quilt because Forge spans the most Minecraft versions and is very tightly integrated into it.
